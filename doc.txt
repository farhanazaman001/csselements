Non Semantic Elements:- Traditionally, developers have implemented non-semantic elements with a class attribute to define the structure and express the meaning of content. It tells nothing about its content. The element has no special meaning at all. It represents its children. It can be used with the class, lang, and title attributes to mark up semantics common to a group of consecutive elements.
1.	 <div> 
2.	 <span>
Example:
1.	<div class="article">
2.	  <div class="header"
3.	        <h1>My blog post</h1>
4.	        <p>An example using divs with classes instead of the new elements.</p>
5.	      </div>
6.	      <!-- ... content ... -->
7.	  </div>
